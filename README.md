# Stock-Market-Prediction-using-LSTM

This project focuses on predicting stock prices using deep learning techniques, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models. It allows users to interactively view predicted vs. actual stock prices using a user-friendly Gradio interface. The model has been trained to predict stock prices for well-known companies like Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Google (GOOGL).
